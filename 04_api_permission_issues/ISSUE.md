## Problem Statement
A task in Airflow failed with:
# HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: ... 

The request reached the API but was rejected due to insufficient permissions.

## Possible Root Causes
- API key/token is expired or incorrect.
- Airflow Connection does not match required role permissions.
- The external system's organization/project settings block the operation.
- API endpoint is correct but the calling service account lacks access.
## Key Questions
- Was the token updated recently?
- Can the same request succeed when run locally using the same credentials?
- Has the API provider changed its authentication requirements?
