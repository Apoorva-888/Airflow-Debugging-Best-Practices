# Case 4 â€“ API Authorization or Permission Issues

**Objective:**  
Identify and resolve permission-related errors (403 Forbidden) when Airflow tasks call external APIs.

**Why Important?**  
A 403 error means the request reached the server, but the credentials used are **not authorized** for that resource.  
In Airflow, this often points to:
- Expired or invalid API tokens
- Misconfigured connection IDs
- Incorrect user/role permissions in the external system
