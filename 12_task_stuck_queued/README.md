# Scenario 12 â€“ Task Stuck in Queued State

## Overview

This example demonstrates a common Apache Airflow issue where a task gets stuck in the **queued** state and never progresses to **running** or **success**.

The cause can be due to:
- No available workers in the Celery/KubernetesExecutor pool.
- Scheduler not picking up queued tasks due to misconfiguration.
- Resource constraints (e.g., pool size limits, concurrency caps).
- Deadlocked worker processes.

This repository contains:
- A minimal reproducible Airflow DAG (`queued_task_example.py`) that simulates a stuck queued task.
- Realistic sample logs.
- Documentation for the issue and troubleshooting.
- Example dummy dataset (`data/dummy_input.csv`).
