# Issue: Task Failing Locally or Remotely in Airflow
## Problem Description
A DAG task intermittently fails when executed either:
- **Locally** (via `airflow tasks test` or `airflow dags trigger`)
- **Remotely** (in production Airflow deployment)
### Local Failure Symptoms
- Python dependency not found.
- Connection to service fails (no internet or local config missing).
- Wrong Python interpreter.
### Remote Failure Symptoms
- Task fails due to missing environment variables in production.
- Airflow worker node memory exhaustion.
- Remote API or database timeout.
## Impact
- DAG execution is interrupted.
- Data pipelines fail to complete, affecting downstream dependencies.
## Expected Behavior
Tasks should execute successfully in both local and remote environments.
## Root Cause Examples
- Local: Missing `requests` package in virtual environment.
- Remote: Missing AWS credentials in production environment variables.
