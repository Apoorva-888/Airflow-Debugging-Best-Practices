# Case 3 â€“ Task Logs Analysis

**Objective:**  
Identify what the logs reveal about a task's failure or execution pattern in Airflow.

**Why Important?**  
Logs are the primary source of truth for debugging Airflow task failures.  
Analyzing them helps to pinpoint:
- Errors in the DAG or task code
- Infrastructure issues (e.g., worker crashes, memory errors)
- External dependency failures (e.g., API timeouts, DB connection errors)
