# Scenario 11 â€“ Timezone Mismatch Causing Missed Runs
This scenario demonstrates how timezone configuration mismatches between an orchestration tool (like Airflow) and the system/server timezone can cause scheduled jobs to run at incorrect times or be missed entirely.
## ðŸ“Œ Problem Summary
- **Symptom:** Jobs not running at the expected time.
- **Root Cause:** Mismatch between:
  - System timezone
  - Scheduler timezone
  - Cron expression interpretation
- **Impact:** Data pipelines run too early, too late, or skip runs.
